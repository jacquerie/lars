\begin{abstract}
In this paper we introduce Tibor, an innovative implementation of an
event-driven server-side cache for static files. Tibor was developed during the
\href{https://facebook.com/hackepfl}{EPFL Facebook Hackathon}, in the wee hours
of the morning. The authors take full responsibility for the horrors contained
in its codebase.

\section{Introduction}
Drawing on their experience as contributors to Invenio, the library powering
several of the biggest digital libraries of Europe\footnote{Among which the
CERN Document Server, INSPIRE and the Infoscience project at EPFL}, the
authors noticed the opportunity for creating a software specialized in the
server-side caching of static files.

In fact, the serving of static files of sizes ranging from modest (for example,
the papers of the High Energy Physics community stored in INSPIRE) to
significant (for example, the historical movies stored in the CERN Document
Server) is at odds with the aging architecture of the Invenio library, a
problem that can only be alleviated, but not solved, by falling back to the
Apache Web Server.

The authors propose Tibor, a novel solution written in C as a stand-alone
library with minimal dependencies. To demonstrate its versatility, the authors
provide a proof-of-concept integration with Elli, an Erlang web server.

Even if this won't provide a solution to the problem the authors are facing,
we confide that this integration constitutes sufficient proof of the wide
applicability of this solution to disparate domains.

\section{High Level Architecture}
As most caches, Tibor in structured in two levels, conventionally called ``L1''
and ``L2''. It is expected that accesses to the L1 cache are significantly
faster than those to the second level, at the price of a smaller cache size.
In the next section we will describe the data structures and the search
algorithms that Tibor uses to achieve this goal.

Tibor is configured, as nowadays is common, by editing a file in the JSON
format. In the third section we will describe its format, the currently
supported features and the plans for extending them.

In the fourth section we will describe Jiří, the mechanism that Tibor uses to
communicate with the Elli web server.

Finally, in the last section, we will describe the Simko prototype to visualize
and provide guidance in improving Tibor's performance.

\section{Simko: a visualization layer for Tibor}
While developing Tibor, the authors noticed that its users could benefit from
inspecting the status of the cache and diagnosing its inefficiencies, either
caused by misconfiguration or by bugs in the software.

The authors decided to implement a tool that would allow the users to easily identify
missed opportunities for optimization

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we presented Tibor, an event-driven server-side cache for static
files. TODO

The authors would like to thank their bosses Tibor Šimko, Jiří Kunčar and Lars
Holm Nielsen for being constant sources of inspiration. The authors also thank
Marios Kogias for the productive conversations that shaped the design of the
Tibor library, and for having the courage to step back at a crucial moment in
Tibor's history.
